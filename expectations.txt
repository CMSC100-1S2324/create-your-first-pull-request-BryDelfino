DELFINO, BRYAN KYLE V.		CMSC 100 - Web Programming
2021-02141			
Laboratory Section EF-2L


For CMSC 100, my expectations are the following:


- I expect the course to be a challenge. With this challenge, it will make us skilled enough to do web programming.

- I expect to learn new technologies related to web programming. Currently, what I have in my web dev repertoire as a Computer Science student are the ability to program
  in JavaScript (let's include HTML & CSS). With this course, I expect to improve my skills in these languages plus to know more technologies like the MERN stack which 
  is very important in today's web development scene.

- I expect this class to be friendly to those who are new to the concept of web development. With this being said, I expect the information given to us will be as easily
  digestable as possible so that student's like me can retain the knowledge given.

- I expect this class to improve my cooperation skills and prepare me for the industry and future CMSC classes.

- Lastly, I expect this course to be fun and interesting. The lecture class is already fun and interesting since it is fascinating to hear stories from someone in the 
  first batch of CMSC students in UPLB. It is also fascinating to see the technology evolve throughout the years. I hope this laboratory class is fun and interesting 
  with its more hands-on approach.

  

Christian Rojano's Comments:

- First off, I completely agree with all your expectations in this course and surely the whole class will agree too as it sums up into great expectations. In the first lecture class, our class really had a journey and dive into the developments of web programming as we were presented with first-hand experience of the astonishing improvements in the said technologies. Also, I expect that our class will have fun with the hands-approach of web programming while acquiring proficiency in the programming languages and frameworks mainly the MERN stack to be able to have a triumphant journey and have manifested great teamwork skills.
